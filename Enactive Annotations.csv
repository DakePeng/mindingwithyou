The process of sedimentation can be understood as a river sculpting the landscape over time. A river carries sediment depositing layers, and shaping the terrain. This is just like how experiences accumulate within the individual over time. Each experience is like a little portion of sediment carried by the river of consciousness. The lived body in this analogy is the landscape itself, as it's shaped by the flow of the river.

2,From Static to Genetic Phenomenology,29,"From a genetic standpoint, however, this way of thinking remains abstract because it ignores the temporal development and individuation of the subject. The “I” or “ego” is not a mere “empty pole” of selfhood in experience but a concrete subject having habits, interests, convictions, and capabilities as a result of accumulated experience.

Here are some notes from a paper that I wrote before:
For Lacan, before the mirror stage, infants originally see their bodies as fragmented and themselves and others as one. In the process of subconsciously identifying with the mirror image, we establish a kind of narcissism that empowers and enthralls us to control our body, thus (mis-)separating it from the world. 
On the other hand, Merleau-Ponty observes that the child was shocked by the fact that their parent’s sound came from a different direction than the mirror, and then, quickly, the child learns to distinguish their parent and the image of their parent — all of which happening faster than them being able to distinguish themselves from their mirror image. It is through the learning that the parent’s mirror image develops after their body, Merleau-Ponty claims, that the child understands that their own body is associated with the mirror image. Subsequently, through the image in the mirror, they understand their body can also be perceived externally — by themselves looking at the mirror and by others looking at them (that is, they have assumed a “body image”).",Connection

In particular, it means being influenced and affected on an aesthetic level, in the original Greek sense of aisthesis as sense perception, including especially the perception and felt experience of what is attractive and unattractive. Thus the thought behind the active/passive distinction is that our active orientation toward things in practical or theoretical reason, or artistic creation, presupposes a deeper and more fundamental openness to the world.

This self-surpassing mentality is a structural precondition for cultural forms in the first place (even while it is always already reciprocally constituted by them in any of its concrete instances). Exemplified in the human order, this mentality is emergent not simply in relation to the living order overall, but also in relation to higher animals (1963, pp. 175–176).","This quote really resonates.

This self-maintenance defines what the system is internally, but also how it relates to and interacts with the world outside.

A face, therefore, is not only an expression of a self available for others to read, but to some extent the self is constituted in the face and developed, and experienced, in the interaction between faces.","This reminds me of Levinas's idea of the face of the other.  In that argument (from my limited understanding), it is through facing the other and understanding that oneself can be other to others, or even further, that one cannot be a subject without others, that we start to develop a sense of morality.","Add Context , Connection"
13,The Phenomenological Concept of Empathy,391,"When we perceive another, we perceive her as ""there"" in relation to us ""here"". We do not experience another's movements as mechanical but as alive, spontaneous, and volitional.","I think the idea of empathy as recognizing ""humanness"" by way of spontinaity/unpredictability can be extended to other domains. It reminded me of Gary Kasparov's chess match against Deep Blue. For earlier versions of the program, the computer would be mechanical, waiting a set amount of time before each move. To try to throw Kasparov off his game, later versions of the computer added some randomness and was programmed to make a quick decision after Kasparov made a questionable move, trying to appear more like a confident human player and throw him off.

13,Enculturation,404,"""Evolution is not simply change in gene frequencies, but ""change in the distribution and constitution of developmental (organism-environment) systems.""""","This makes me wonder if an adequate study of evolution will require not only a history of a species, but also a history of environments. In other words, Thompson's point seems to entitle us (and indeed necessitate us) to speak of the evolution of environments as well as the evolution of species. If this is the case, it seems like we need a new kind of non-positivist (at least in the sense of positive, discrete entities) method that is simultaneously more than introspection and more than brute, material history. At the same time, I wonder how suited much of our language is to this task. My big question is whether language is permanently fixed in this positivist mode, or whether we can devise a relational language.",Question
