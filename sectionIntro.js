This concept is broader than our daily usage of \"intention\", in which one has something or some target in mind. Phenomenological intentionality is a relationship between consciousness and something beyond it — an object, a concept, or a world of possibilities. Phenomenology claims that we experience things when we actively make that relationship. The subject does not precede the object in this action. Experience happens not in the subject but in the action.</p><p><i>--- Dake, Jamie, Kieran, Lauren</i></p>`
