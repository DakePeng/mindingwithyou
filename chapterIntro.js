        "content": "<h1>Chapter 2: The Phenomenological Connection</h1><p>There is a deep connection between <i>Enactivism</i>, the branch of Cognitive Science that Thompson is know for, and <i>Phenomenology</i>, a philosophical trend that started in the 20th century. <i>Phenomenology</i> sees cognition as a relationship between the subject and the object, and thus invites a consideration of the environment and interaction when we study consciousness.</p>"

        "chapter": 3,
        "content": "<h1>Chapter 3: Autonomy and Emergence</h1><p><i>Enactivism</i> trys to describe autonomy in a dynamic system where the participants are always interacting with one another. For a system to be <i>autonomous</i>, it should be constantly determine itself through maintaining the boundaries between itself and the environment. Another idea core to this argument is Emergence, the idea that higher orders of cognition is built upon convolutions of layers of systems.</p>"

        "content": "<h1>Chapter 4: The Structure of Behavior</h1><p>This chapter goes back to a famous phenomenologist, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who redefines <i>behavior</i> as the process in which the organisms and their environment mutually form each other. Following this, the chapter sketches a topology of different orders of such inteactions, building from the physical matter to the living beings, and then to the human mind.</p>"

        "content": "<h1>Chapter 8: Life beyond The Gap</h1><p>Philosphers have long been trapped by the so called <i>Mind-Body Problem</i>: how can we explain the gap between them? How does the mind control the body, or how does the body talk to the mind? For Thompson, this is a non-problem. The relationship happens between different parts of the body, or between the physical and lived bodies."

        "content": "<h1>Chapter 9: Sensorimotor Subjectivity</h1><p>This chapter discusses <i>senses</i> and <i>perception</i>. It points out that these activities are not purely passive, but also involves a bodily exploration of the word through <i>motor movements</i>. It is this interaction that brings us an understanding of our <i>self</i>, which allows us to establish a <i>subjectivity</i>.</p>"

        "content": "<h1>Chapter 12: Primordial Dynamism: Emotion and Valence</h1><p>For <i>Enactivism</i>, emotion is not an internal status but rather an outward movement. It is spawned in the dynamic interchanging between the body and the environment and the different ways of percieving valences, or values, that this body-environmrnt coupling provides. It is followed by an action that your entire body participates in, as limb and muscle movements, facial expressions, or even as invisible as changes in your internal chemical systems.</p>"

        "content": "<h1>Chapter 13: Empathy and Enculturation</h1><p>This chapter introduces empathy as based on <i>intersubjectivity</i>, the idea that the <i>subject</i>, or self, is established in an interconnected network of selves that is filled with culture and built through history. Empathy is to involve your own body into an interactive system with another body, sensing what others sense and imagining living in others' shoes.</p>"
