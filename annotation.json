This question is one that I feel in connected to the ideas Thompson discusses in this section because the phenomenological attitude by my understanding is stepping back from getting caught up in our own \"first person point of view\" and taking things only as they are and how we experience them, not trying to go beyond identifying how we experience something. \nPage 234 of this link: https://icrrd.com/public/media/15-05-2021-13031510-percent-Happier-Dan-Harris.pdf",

        "Annotation": "I really love this passage for its clarity and concision with respect to Thompson's thesis. One thing that I do wonder about is how much we need a new ontology to fully appreciate these statements. Given how much the physical sciences have made their way into our \"Lifeworld,\" I feel that many of us have a tacit picture of reality as a collection of physical matter distributed in space and interacting over time. This picture is also identifiable in the everyday framing of the so-called hard problem of consciousness: 'how is it that a hunk of inanimate matter could develop awareness of the world?' But it seems to me that the power of Thompson's description is in side-stepping this picture of reality for a different one, one that Thompson doesn't explicitly describe. On this account, consciousness does not belong to the individual, but to the system comprising of the individual and its milieu. Thus consciousness (and perhaps the difficulty is that this word seems irrecusably \"subjective\") exists as a structural phenomenon. But once again, if we are to overturn our old picture of reality, we have to see this structure as inseparable from its \"components,\" we cannot separate form and matter any more.",
